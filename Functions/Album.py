'''
Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album  
The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information  
Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums  Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly 
Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album  
If the calling line includes a value for the num- ber of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary  
Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album
