'''
Make a class called User  Create two attributes called first_name and last_name,
 and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user pro le  Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information  
 Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user 
Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user 

--------

 Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class from Exercise 9-3 (page 166)  Write a method called increment_ login_attempts() that increments the value of login_attempts by 1  
 Write another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_ attempts to 0 
Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times  
Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented properly, and then call reset_login_attempts()  
Print login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0ma
