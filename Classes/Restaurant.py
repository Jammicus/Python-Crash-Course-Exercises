'''
Make a class called Restaurant  The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type  
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi- cating that the restaurant is open 
Make an instance called restaurant from your class  Print the two attri- butes individually, and then call both methods 
----------
Start with your class from Exercise 9-1  Create three different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each instance 

---------

Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166)  Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0  
Create an instance called restaurant from this class  Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again 
Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been served  Call this method with a new number and print the value again 
Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served  
Call this method with any num- ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business
